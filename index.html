    For this assignment, I utilized HTML and CSS syntax that I learned from the following websites:
    https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML
    https://blog.hubspot.com/website/change-font-in-html
    I've never used HTML or CSS before so it's very likely that I made syntax errors even though
    my webpage seems to look the way I wanted it to; I'd love to hear any corrections or tips.
